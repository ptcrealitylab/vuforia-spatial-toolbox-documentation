# Getting Started with the Vuforia Spatial Toolbox

This section will give you an illustrated introduction to using the Vuforia Spatial Toolbox app.
By the end of this section, you'll know about a wide variety of things you can do in AR using the
Spatial Toolbox app, and you should be ready to try it out for yourself. You'll learn how to add
new *tools* to a space and connect them together into spatial programs.

You'll also learn how to set up a Vuforia Spatial Edge Server, if you want to do more with the
app, and how to configure it through a web interface on your computer.

If you're _not_ a developer, this is the most important (and maybe the only) section for you to
read.

If you _are_ a developer, you should read this first, and then read the Develop section after you
feel comfortable using the app and server.
