# Dive Deeper

If you want to more deeply understand the concepts and architecture behind the Vuforia Spatial
Toolbox, this section offers a series of detailed articles explaining the inner-workings of the
system.

The average user shouldn't need to read this section, but if you want to contribute source code
to the project or develop a complex system using the platform, you'll want to understand this
material.

If you still have questions about the system after reading this, don't hesitate to ask on our
 [forum](http://forum.spatialtoolbox.vuforia.com).
