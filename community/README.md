Vuforia Spatial Toolbox is an open source project, licensed under MPL 2.0, and we encourage you
to join our community and contribute to the project in whatever way you can. Anyone is welcome
and encouraged to be a part of our community, whether you're a student looking to learn about
Augmented Reality and Spatial Computing, a hobbyist looking to experiment with some DIY projects,
an innovation engineer looking to use this in your industry, or a researcher looking to push the
boundaries of this platform even further.

## How to Participate

### Forum

The main hub of our community is the [Spatial Toolbox Forum](http://forum.spatialtoolbox.vuforia.com).
Introduce yourself, ask questions, share your knowledge, discuss new ideas, and inspire others by
showing what you've built.

### GitHub

All of the code is hosted on the [PTC Reality Lab GitHub](https://github.com/ptcrealitylab) in a
handful of repositories. Clone these to compile customized versions of the software that you can
modify with new features. Feel free to fork these and make your own changes, which you can share
back to the community.

- [vuforia-spatial-toolbox-ios](https://github.com/ptcrealitylab/vuforia-spatial-toolbox-ios)
    - This is the main repository for the Vuforia Spatial Toolbox iOS app.
- [vuforia-spatial-toolbox-userinterface](https://github.com/ptcrealitylab/vuforia-spatial-toolbox-userinterface)
    - This contains the user interface that gets loaded into the iOS app.
- [vuforia-spatial-edge-server](https://github.com/ptcrealitylab/vuforia-spatial-edge-server)
    - This is the main repository for the Vuforia Spatial Edge Server.
- [vuforia-spatial-core-addon](https://github.com/ptcrealitylab/vuforia-spatial-core-addon)
    - This contains the core set of tools, interfaces, nodes, and blocks.

#### Create new Add-ons

The easiest way to contribute new features, rather than editing the above source code, is to
build new add-ons for the system. Read the [Develop](../develop/add-ons) section to learn how.
