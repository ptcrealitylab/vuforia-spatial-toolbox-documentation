## Creating a New Hardware Interface

This tutorial will show you how to create a new Hardware Interface in an add-on.

### Setting up a new add-on

If you've already gone through the [Spatial Tool tutorial](../spatial-tools/tutorial), you can
reuse the addon called `my-addon` that you created in that tutorial. If not, create a new
directory called `my-addon` in the `vuforia-spatial-edge-server/addons` directory.

Now, create a directory called `interfaces` in `my-addon`. Each directory within `interfaces`
will be a separate hardware interface – a new "plugin" for this server to communicate with an
external system.

### Create the index.js file

Create a directory in `interfaces` called `testInterface`, and then create a file called `index.js`
inside `testInterface`. The index.js file of each hardware interface will get executed by the Edge
Server when the Node.js environment finishes initializing the Edge Server's core capabilities.
This file is isolated from the rest of the server with the exception of the server's
`libraries/hardwareInterfaces.js` file, which provides an API that hardware interfaces can use
to bridge the functionality of the server to external hardware.

All hardware interfaces can be set up with the following template:

```javascript
// include the hardware interface API module from the server
let server = require('@libraries/hardwareInterfaces');

// load any persistent settings for this interface, such as whether it is enabled
let settings = server.loadHardwareInterface(__dirname);

// export these so that the hardware interface can be configured on the web interface
exports.enabled = settings('enabled');
exports.configurable = true;

if (exports.enabled) {
    // place your interface code here
    // doing so properly ignores this interface if it has been disabled on the web interface
}
```

### Using the Hardware Interface API

Inside the template, you will need to access some combination of the Hardware Interface APIs
based on what you want this interface to do.

In general, implementing a hardware interface looks like this:

1. Determine which nodes you want to connect to the hardware. This can be hard-coded or loaded
from external settings.
2. Implement a hardware-specific method for how to send data to that piece of hardware when data
arrives at one of these nodes.
3. Implement a hardware-specific method to listen to new values being generated by the hardware
, and to send those values into the Spatial Toolbox system.

The corresponding APIs, which are only a subset of the provided APIs but are the most common ones to
use are:

- [addNode](./api-reference#addNode)
- [addReadListener](./api-reference#addReadListener)
- [write](./api-reference#write)

*(Clicking on these will bring you to their API documentation)*

If you've already gone through the [Spatial Tool tutorial](../spatial-tools/tutorial), you'll
notice that these are similar (but not identical) to the APIs available to tools.

Each of these functions has three parameters for `object`, `tool`, and `node` – the
combination of which lets you specificy the address of a specific node on a speciic frame of a
specific object.

`addNode` lets you create a new node on a *local frame* (one that you created through the server's
web interface, not one dropped in from the pocket) with a specific name.

`addReadListener` lets you subscribe to new data reaching this node from other tools and links in
the system, so that you can send each new data packet to the hardware.

`write` lets you write a new data packet to the node whenever you hear from the hardware, so that
the value will propagate across links to other nodes. You'll need to set up your own method to
listen to values from your hardware so that you know when to trigger this.

### Looking at an example: Kepware Interface

Lets look at a simplified implementation of the
[Kepware hardware interface](https://github.com/ptcrealitylab/vuforia-spatial-core-addon/blob/master/interface/kepware/index.js)
as an example. The Kepware interface uses a REST API to the
[KEPServerEx IoT Gateway](https://www.kepware.com/en-us/products/kepserverex/advanced-plug-ins/iot-gateway/)
to read and write data to Industrial IoT hardware.

```javascript
let server = require('@libraries/hardwareInterfaces');
let settings = server.loadHardwareInterface(__dirname);
exports.enabled = settings('enabled');
exports.configurable = true;

if (exports.enabled) {
    let objectName = 'myHardwareObject';
    let frameName = 'myHardwareFrame';

    // 1 - create a node named 'value' on the frame..
    // (this will only create it if it doesn't already exist)
    server.addNode(objectName, frameName, 'value', 'node');

    // 2 - you may need to include different node modules based on the protocol your hardware uses
    let Client = require('node-rest-client').Client;
    let remoteDevice = new this.Client();
    let IOT_GATEWAY_URL = 'http://10.10.10.10:39320/iotgateway/';

    // 3 - when data arrives at this node, send it to the hardware
    // in this case we're using a REST API but could use bluetooth, serialport, etc
    server.addReadListener(objectName, frameName, 'value', function(data) {
        let args = {
            data: [{id: 'value', v: data.value}],
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
        };
        this.remoteDevice.post(IOT_GATEWAY_URL + 'write', args, function (_data, _res) {
            console.log('successfully sent data to hardware');
        }).on('error', function (err) {
            console.warn('error sending data to hardware', err);
        });
    });

    let updateRateInMilliseconds = 100;
    let previousValue = null;

    // 4 - set up an interval to periodically check if the hardware has changed
    setInterval(function() {
        remoteDevice.get(IOT_GATEWAY_URL + 'read?ids=value', function (data, _res) {
            let newValue = data.readResults[0].v;
            if (newValue !== previousValue) {
                // if we have a new value, write it from the hardware to the node
                server.write(objectName, frameName, 'value', newValue);
                console.log('received new data from hardware');
                previousValue = newValue;
            }
        });
    }, updateRateInMilliseconds);
}
```

This won't be completely functional – there are a lot more details in the
[Kepware hardware interface](https://github.com/ptcrealitylab/vuforia-spatial-core-addon/blob/master/interfaces/kepware/index.js)
in order to make this really work, but the main logic is all there. In **step 1**, we add a node
with a specific name that we will use for all of our communication between the Vuforia Spatial
Toolbox and the external hardware system. In **step 2**, we set up our environment by including
the Node.js modules needed to communicate in the protocol that the hardware system uses. In
**step 3**, we add an event listener for data arriving to our node from other parts of the
Vuforia Spatial Toolbox system, and when that happens we forward the data to the hardware. In
**step 4**, we ask the hardware for its current value 10 times per second, and if the value ever
changes we write it to the node so that it propagates throughout the Vuforia Spatial Toolbox
system.

### More APIs

There are a lot more APIs that haven't been explored yet in this tutorial, but you can find them
all listed on the [API Reference](./api-reference) page. Hardware interfaces are extremely
flexible with what you can do with them. An advanced hardware interface developer will be able to
extend the Vuforia Spatial Toolbox in new and unexpected ways.

### Making it configurable

One big difference between this and the actual Kepware implementation is that we've hard-coded a
lot of data (the objectName, the frameName, the IP address of the KEPServerEX, etc), whereas the
full implementation makes use of configurable settings so that these parameters can be specified
using the server's web interface. To learn how to add those, you can read the advanced-level
tutorial:
[How to add configurable settings to your hardware interface](../../tutorials/adding-settings-to-hardware-interface).
